## Development Setup

For developers wishing to contribute or work on advanced features, follow these additional steps:

1. Install the dependencies with the development tools:
    ```bash
    poetry install --with dev
    ```

2. Configure the pre-commit hooks:
    ```bash
    poetry shell
    ```

3. Set up the hooks in your repository:
    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

4. It is recommended to use **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** as the IDE. Install the **Run and Debug** extension to run the project directly from the editor.

Hooks will run automatically on each commit. To run them manually on all files, use:
```bash
    pre-commit run --all-files
```
